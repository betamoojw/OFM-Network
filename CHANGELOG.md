# Changes

* feature: Add a built-in **web server** (`OPENKNX_WEBSERVER`) with an overview page — available on both ESP32 and RP2040
* feature: Add a browser-based **device console** (`OPENKNX_WEBCONSOLE`) — run console commands and view the log from the browser
* feature: Add a **file manager** (`OPENKNX_WEBFS`) for the device's flash storage — browse, upload, and delete files from the browser (directory and file names are HTML/JS-escaped in the listing)
* feature: Add an **MQTT client and broker** (`OPENKNX_MQTT`) — no external dependencies, available on both ESP32 and RP2040
* feature: Add an **HTTP(S) client** (`OPENKNX_WEBCLIENT`) for the device to call out to other services, with certificate verification
* feature: Add a **group monitor** (`OPENKNX_WEBMONITOR`) — live, ETS-style view of KNX telegrams in the browser (TP devices only)
* feature: Add **ping support** — check host reachability by IP or hostname, from the console (`ping <target>`) or via API
